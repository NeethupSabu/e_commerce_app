## Getting Started

An  e-commerce  app using Flutter and Provider for state management. This app features a home screen displaying categories, with all items shown by default. Users can select a category to view items specific to that category. Clicking on an item reveals its details, including images, colors, prices, and descriptions. Users can add items to their cart or mark them as favorites, with updates reflected instantly. The cart section displays total amounts and allows for item removal.
